It's a beautiful day outside
Birds are singing
Flowers are blooming...
One days like these, kids like you...
Should be burning in hell

Do you think that even the worst person can change?
That everyone can be a good person if they just try? ...
Hehe ... well, then, there is a better question...
Do you wanna have a bad time?

The end
