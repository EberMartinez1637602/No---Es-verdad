It's a beautiful day outside
Birds are singing
Flowers are blooming...
One days like these, kids like you...
Should be burning in hell

Do you think that even the worst person can change?
That everyone can be a good person if they just try? ...
Hehehe... well, then, there is a better question to you...
Do you wanna have a bad time?

You want to return to the world that you destroyed ...
Killing you now ... it would only be an act of compassion



The end
